IN PROGRESS


I love to read so I decided to build a Book Keeper app where I can keep track of the books I have read, am reading currently or want to read.

I wanted to build an app that uses Firebase to store data and to be able to edit the database.

I used React (create-react-app) and wanted to try to optimize my use of components so that I could make my code dry.

I also decided to style my app using Sass instead of CSS which was an intersting learning experience. I made a separate scss file for each component.

I also wanted to build it mobile first in design.
